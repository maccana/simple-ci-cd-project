# simple-ci-cd-project

This project demonstrates a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. It runs a shell script automatically when code is pushed.

## How It Works

- GitHub Actions triggers on every push to `main`
- It runs `script.sh` to simulate a build/test step

## Why This Project?

This is a minimal example designed for technical writers to showcase:
- Clear documentation
- Basic automation
- GitHub Actions usage
